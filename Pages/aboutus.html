        We help identify and educate people with dyslexia in a way that they can learn to read, write
        and spell.
        “In kindergarten, my daughter had signs of Dyslexia, but no one knew what that meant or how best to
        help her.
        She received special help daily to help her maintain and catch up. She did not catch up. We struggled.
        She was and is so aware of how she is different, unable to read fluently like her friends. Curious about
        Dyslexia, we searched for answers. We found Dyslexia is much more than just reading backwards. After
        many special education teachers, many optometrists, vision therapy, education centers, Phonics
        programs, an answer was found with Susan Barton and the Reading and Spelling system to work with
        Dyslexic individuals.
        The progress has been obvious.

        Her confidence has grown along with her reading and spelling ability, right before my eyes.”
