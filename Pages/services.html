      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      <p>
        We help identify and educate people with dyslexia in a way that they can learn to read, write
        and spell.
        “In kindergarten, my daughter had signs of Dyslexia, but no one knew what that meant or how best to
        help her.
        She received special help daily to help her maintain and catch up. She did not catch up. We struggled.
        She was and is so aware of how she is different, unable to read fluently like her friends. Curious about
        Dyslexia, we searched for answers. We found Dyslexia is much more than just reading backwards. After
        many special education teachers, many optometrists, vision therapy, education centers, Phonics
        programs, an answer was found with Susan Barton and the Reading and Spelling system to work with
        Dyslexic individuals.
        The progress has been obvious.

        Her confidence has grown along with her reading and spelling ability, right before my eyes.”

        <h3>Screening</h3>
        <p>
          Screening for dyslexia is appropriate for children or adults and will cover a battery of individual tests,
          looking at working memory, auditory memory, processing speeds, auditory discrimination, phonological
          awareness and memory. For children this will also take into consideration school records such as
          Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), Accommodations, 504 plans, Report Cards. Screening for dyslexia
          can give you peace of mind, answers, knowledge, understanding, at any age. Ask for a free consultation
          to review your IEP goals and accommodations.

      <h3>Tutoring</h3>
      <p>
          Several methods and programs are available. Find a certified tutor who works with an Orton-Gillingham
          based system. Tutoring will begin before phonics to focus on blending and breaking apart phonemes
          (the sounds of our language). Phonics will not work until the sounds can be broken apart and pulled
          together. A good tutoring system will work on reading, spelling and writing and will go at the pace of the
          individual being tutored. 
          The Barton Reading and Spelling system is used at Outside Insight, LLC. Contact our office to setup a
          FREE consultation.
