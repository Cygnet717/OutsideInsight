        What does it mean to be Dyslexic, or to have Dyslexia?  Isn’t that where you read things backwards?  Some common symptoms include difficulty reading behind that of peers (especially beginning in fourth grade), homework taking much longer than it should, weekly spelling tests are studied for endlessly, difficulty learning to tie shoes, confusion of left and right, before and after, yesterday and tomorrow, a slow reader, mistake b and d when reading or writing.  Each individual with Dyslexia has their own mix of challenges; no two people have the exact same symptoms.  Identifying if an individual has Dyslexia requires several tests be administered, scored and interpreted.
        Children who have been tested by the school system will often receive a tag of Learning Disability or Specific Learning Disability.  Small group instruction given for students with an IEP is a step in the right direction, but that instruction is often not best suited for a student with Dyslexia.  A Dyslexic child will learn best with an individualized Orton-Gillingham approach that is simultaneously multisensory, explicit, and systematic.  One on one tutoring with a certified tutor two to three times a week is ideal for building skills and confidence needed to get up to grade level and overcome dyslexia.  There is no quick fix, but with a good support system anything is possible. 
        Several famous people have dyslexia.

        looking at working memory, auditory memory, processing speeds, auditory discrimination, Phonological
        Awareness and Memory. For children this will also take into consideration school records such as
        Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), Accommodations, 504 plans, Report Cards. Screening for Dyslexia
        can give you peace of mind, answers, knowledge, understanding, at any age. Ask for a free consultation

    <h3>Tutoring</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Several methods and programs are available. Find a certified tutor who works with an Orton-Gillingham
        based system. Tutoring will begin before phonics to focus on blending and breaking apart phonemes
        (the sounds of our language). Phonics will not work until the sounds can be broken apart and pulled
        together. A good tutoring system will work on reading, spelling and writing and will go at the pace of the
        individual being tutored. 
        The Barton Reading and Spelling system is used at Outside Insight, LLC. Contact our office to setup a
        FREE consultation.
