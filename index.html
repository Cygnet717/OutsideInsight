        <h3>Dyslexia</h3>
          <p>It is estimated that more than one in five people have Dyslexia.  Dyslexia is more than just seeing things backwards; it is a neurological based challenge. 
          Breaking down the Greek roots of the word, Dys means problem with and Lexia means language.  Children who have Dyslexia are often labeled as delayed, lazy or stupid, while they are really trying harder and working more than their peers.  Obviously they are smart they can verbalize at the same level as their peers.  Just waiting for a child to “catch up” to their peers, could be wasting time, energy and worst of all, killing self-esteem.

          A Dyslexic child KNOWS they are different.
