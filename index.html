        <p>– It is estimated that more than one in ten people have Dyslexia. Dyslexia is more than just
        seeing things backwards; it is a neurological based problem. Breaking down the Greek roots of the
        word, Dys means problem with and Lexia means language. Children who have Dyslexia are often
        labeled as delayed, lazy or stupid, while they are really trying harder and working more than their peers.
        Obviously they are smart they can verbalize at the same level as their peers. Just waiting for a child to
        “catch up” to their peers, could waste time, energy and worst of all, slowly kill their self-esteem.</p>

        <p>Relationships can be challenging and communication is a finger pointer as to why some relationships
        work and others do not. Whether you are a parent, teacher, coworker, spouse, or family member, you
        can only be responsible for your actions and reactions. Problems arise when the intended message is
        not what is interpreted, causing misunderstanding and possibly hurt feelings, which may escalate. It is
        possible to recognize when this happens and to diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand. Be
        yourself and be appreciated for who you are.</p>
